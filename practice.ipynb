       "   'content': \"After 79 days without it, we recently regained access to Tesla FSD Beta (V10.69), along with Tesla’s latest software version, 2022. 20.15. A week later we got the download for version 2022.20.17. For more background, see: “ Tesla Full Self Driving Beta: Lost & Found! We Lost It After 206 Days, Got It Back Again After 79 Days .” Observations since getting access to FSD Beta again We are about to head back to Utah, but so far, all of our recent driving with FSD Beta has been in rural Northern Wisconsin. It is really fun to sit in our driveway, put the car in Drive, pull the right stock down twice, and have the car drive perfectly without intervention to most locations within 50 miles that we put into the navigation. However, on only the second day that I got back access to Tesla’s FSD Beta, I already used one of my new allotment of 5 forced disengagement events. All Tesla owners: Automatic steering that every Tesla owner has requires the driver to keep a little torque on the steering wheel, but you can look anywhere you want, eat, text, whatever without consequences. ( See new warning below! ) FSD Beta drivers: FSD Beta is much more invasive. The camera above the rear-view mirror is looking at your face. The software can tell if you are looking at the screen to your right, looking down at your phone or at something you are eating, and maybe even if your eyes are shut. If you do any of these things for more than 15 seconds, you get an audible and visual warning. I think I got my new forced disengagement for looking at a drink in my lap for only 30 seconds. Bottom line: Keep your eyes fixed on the road. Don’t even look at or use the control screen on you right for more than 15 seconds if you don’t want to lose your FSD Beta functionality. If you do get an audible and visual warning, don’t try to correct your behavior — turn off FSD Beta immediately by pushing up on the right control stock. When you are ready to fully concentrate on the road again, you can re-initiate FSD Beta. Alternative: Use voice controls or turn off FSD Beta! Turn it back on again after you adjust the heater or look at the sandwich you are eating, etc. Warning for all Tesla drivers: Big Brother is now watching you! It appears that with the most recent software update, 2022.20.17, everyone using automatic steering will have the camera above the rear-view mirror watching their every move. Note: This is a much better method for determining drive attentiveness than observing torque on the steering wheel. However, it is more invasive. With standard Tesla automatic steering, if you get a forced disengagement, you will only lose access until you put the car in Park and start again. You can do this as many times as needed and you won’t lose access to the functionality. Jerky steering! Most of the steering by FSD Beta is very smooth and accurate. It keeps the car in the center of the lane on highways better than I can do manually. However, on turns onto backroad streets it waits so long that you think it has missed the turn, and then the steering wheel spins just in time to barely make the turn. You can initiate FSD Beta in a Walmart parking lot. However, the steering wheel will jerk like a madman is driving as it makes the turns and sometimes will take you to a dead end. This jerky behavior happens while making sharp turns at very low speeds. Wrong lane selection: Zach and I have observed numerous times that FSD Beta has made a lane selection that is inconsistent with the navigation route. Recently when using FSD Beta, it was navigating perfectly on the low-traffic 46 mile route from our cabin in Three Lakes to Antigo, Wisconsin. As we approached our left turn to TJ Maxx in Antigo on a four-lane road, we were in the righthand lane. I was relieved when it switched to the lefthand lane in preparation for the left turn. I was about to give a cheer to FSD Beta when it changed lanes to the left again and headed directly towards a traffic island. Tesla still has work to do on proper lane selection. Like my editor, Zach Shahan, when approaching a stop light or stop sign, I don’t like that FSD Beta still waits too long, necessitating hard braking. It is not just the regenerative braking — the car’s friction disc brakes are also engaged, which will wear them out sooner over time. For more commentary on this, see my previous article . The remainder of this article was also published in that previous piece, but here it is again for anyone who didn’t read that: I have very much enjoyed being part of Tesla’s ~100,0000 FSD Beta customer testing team . I have obsessively used FSD Beta now for a total 220 days through 6 versions of the software and I have never had an accident or bad scare. As anyone using automatic steering has learned, you know when it is reliable and when you must give special attention and be prepared to intervene. It has been fascinating to watch the improvements in the software with the new versions, but even some backsliding (e.g. Phantom Braking) and some critical failures which have not been addressed (e.g. occasional wrong lane choice and navigation failures). Also, in areas with high traffic density FSD Beta is too timid and unable to make unprotected turns (with no traffic signals) safely. I hope Tesla surprises us, but Zach and I see little chance that Tesla will achieve 100% level 5 automation in the next few years. Summarizing my main observations after regaining access to Tesla FSD Beta I can verbally or with text enter an address or business into the navigation and the car will drive me there with no interventions (in ideal cases). My car will once again auto-steer on single lane roads with no yellow center lines. (There are many roads like this in rural Northern Wisconsin.) You need to put the car in Drive and wait for the little grey steering wheel to appear. At that point, you only need to pull down the right stalk twice to initiate FSD Beta. Then your car will perform all the functions of autosteer and traffic-aware cruise control (TACC) plus all the additional FSD Beta features. My car will again easily make very tight turns marked ~15 mph. For my 79 days as an outcast, my car would bail out in the middle of a tight turn. FSD Beta will also again successfully navigate rotaries. With FSD Beta restored, my car will consistently stop smoothly in the right place at stop signs and stop lights. My car will once again go through green lights automatically. (You would think!) I can once again set the speed more than 5 mph. over the map speed limit. This is especially useful in rural Northern Wisconsin when the map speed limit is often too low. When leaving a 35 mph zone in a town and returning to 55 mph, my car will once again automatically raise the speed back up to 55 or 60 mph. However, I will once again have to limit my observation and use of the control screen on my right or look down at my phone etc. for longer than ~15 seconds or I will be nagged. If I do it too long, I will get a forced disengagement. If I get 4 more forced disengagements I will lose access to FSD Beta again. Please continue to shower me with your own observations, complaints, etc. in the comments section. I am particularly interested how many others have also lost their FSD Beta privileges and have had them restored. Appreciate CleanTechnica’s originality and cleantech news coverage?

       "   'content': \"Elon Musk has an ambitious goal for 2030 for Tesla. He wants the US automaker to be producing 20 million vehicles a year by the end of 2030. For some context, Tesla’s current production and delivery rate is just above a million cars a year. Zooming out and looking at the overall auto market, the top selling automaker in the world last year was Toyota, with 9,562,483 sales. Zooming out even a bit further, pre-pandemic, in 2019, the top selling automaker in the world was Volkswagen Group, with 10,975,352 sales. So, Elon Musk’s goal of 20 million vehicles a year is … well, ambitious may be an understatement. Nonetheless, the automaker is marching on with that goal in sight. With its humble beginnings taking over the NUMMI factory in Silicon Valley, California, in 2010, Tesla has come a long way. Not many — Elon Musk included — expected Tesla to take over that old GM–Toyota factory in 2010 and a decade later be the guiding force behind a massive industry-wide transition to electric cars, trucks, and SUVs. Very few at that time expected Tesla would be producing a million cars a year in 2022. Tesla relied on that Fremont factory for years in order to get off the ground financially in a sustainable way. Then, once the opportunity arose and Tesla had started true automobile mass production, it quickly built and opened up a factory in Shanghai, China. It’s those two factories together that brought Tesla to a manufacturing run rate of a million cars a year. However, 1 million is far from 20 million and backup was quickly arranged from two new gigafactories — one in Germany and one in Texas. The Texas gigafactory is expected to be huge, as it has been designated Tesla’s new global headquarters. At this point, though, it is arguably in its seed stage, or maybe the better metaphor is that it’s just barely sprouting. The big milestone of the month at “Giga Texas” is that it just recently rolled out its 10,000th vehicle. 10,000 Model Ys built at Giga Texas to date pic.twitter.com/4cOlnpCRa0 — Tesla (@Tesla) September 17, 2022 The first 10,000 feel like they took a while, but I’m sure the next 10,000 will come fast, and it won’t be long at all until this milestone feels quaint and irrelevant. In Tesla’s Q2 shareholder report, the company noted an installed annual production capacity of >250,000. That doesn’t mean that Tesla has hit a production rate of >250,000/year, but it does mean the manufacturing equipment is in place that makes that rate of production possible. And that’s just concerning production of the Tesla Model Y. Tesla also plans to produce the Cybertruck there. And, being a “gigafactory” (rather than simply a factory), Tesla also has a battery production component at play in The Lone Star State. From that aforementioned 2nd quarter shareholder report, Tesla writes, “In Texas, we have added flexibility to produce vehicles with either a structural battery pack or legacy battery pack. The next generation of 4680 battery cell machinery has been installed in Texas and is in the process of commissioning. Factory output in Texas continues to grow.” We’ll see what Tesla’s update is in the 3rd quarter 2022 shareholder report and conference call.

An inventor behind the headline-grabbing cyborg cockroaches unveiled earlier this month say the enhanced insects are there to do good. In a new interview with Reuters , Kenjiro Fukuda of the Riken research institute\\'s Thin-Film Device Laboratory explained the use cases he and his team are dreaming up for their remote-controlled Madagascar hissing cockroaches — and, fortunately, they don\\'t sound sinister at all. Specifically, Fukuda et al envision the cyborg roaches helping in search-and-rescue missions during natural disasters. The little buggies can fit into places humans are far too large for, and he says their endurance will be better as well. \"The batteries inside small robots run out quickly, so the time for exploration becomes shorter,\" Fukuda told Reuters . \"A key benefit [of a cyborg insect] is that when it comes to an insect\\'s movements, the insect is causing itself to move, so the electricity required is nowhere near as much.\" Solar Stimulation The way these little guys work is pretty ingenious. Outfitted with solar cell-powered backpacks, these large cockroaches — chosen for their size and lack of wings — get their nerve-like appendages known as cerci stimulated by the packs, which in turn signals to them which direction to move depending on what operators dictate. The tech still has a ways to go — in one demonstration, a cockroach turned left when the researchers signaled for it to do so remotely, but went in circles when it was supposed to go right. But it\\'s still a remarkable feat of science. And while there are indeed many ways that human minds can figure out how to use practically any technology for evil, the explicitly heroic purpose Fukuda and his team have in mind for the these funny little cyborgs is reassuring.

       "   'content': \"“Troy Teslike” tracks Tesla data like no one else I know. In the past day, he published an interesting 2½ year breakdown. The table, below, shows how Tesla’s share of major BEV markets has declined in the past couple of years. Looking at the biggest market, China, first, Tesla’s share of that BEV market dropped from 15.9% in Q2 2020 to 9.0% in Q2 2022. Looking at Europe, Tesla’s share of the BEV market dropped from 15.4% in Q2 2020 to 8.0% in Q2 2020. Looking at the USA (which is barely more than half the size of the European BEV market and far smaller than the Chinese BEV market), Tesla’s share dropped from 82.9% in Q2 2020 to 63.8% in Q2 2020. Combining all of these markets, Tesla’s share of BEV sales (registrations) dropped from 25.1% in Q2 2020 to 15.6% in Q2 2022. Image © Troy Teslike Those drops are quite stunning, but there’s a lot to add for context here. First of all, while Tesla’s share of these BEV markets declined substantially, Tesla’s actual global sales were up considerably. Going from 90,891 deliveries in Q2 2020 to 254,695 deliveries in Q2 2022, Tesla’s sales increased a tremendous 180.2% . With that in mind, the BEV share declines above look quite different. The key point is that as fast as Tesla’s production and sales are growing, these overall BEV markets are growing much faster. As part of that, there are just a lot more electric vehicles on offer these days, and especially a lot more highly compelling, long-range, competitive EVs. There are hundreds of electric car models on the market these days (in Europe and China, at least), and people like diversity and choice. Each new BEV model release attracts new buyers. The biggest point here is that BEV markets are absolutely popping, and that should be seen as a good thing by any genuine Tesla fan since Tesla’s whole mission is to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles and clean, green, sustainable energy. If the market is growing much faster than fast-growing Tesla, that’s great news! Here is the chart for the same table. It shows Tesla's Market Share in (BEV) Battery Electric Vehicles. pic.twitter.com/ECjC2XRsOK — Troy Teslike (@TroyTeslike) September 24, 2022 It’s also worth pointing out that Tesla is selling every vehicle it can make, so it’s not like Tesla is sitting on massive piles of inventory and suffering from weak demand. We don’t know Tesla’s true consumer demand level. However, as Tesla Giga Berlin and Tesla Giga Texas ramp up further, we should get a better idea of how demand for Tesla vehicles is evolving. Although, while I’m not yet ready to read too much into this, it should also be acknowledged that Tesla has started shipping a lot more vehicles to new markets — Australia, Japan, Taiwan. Probably the most common “critique” is one we get here a lot when publishing our various EV sales reports — some people think that cheap electric cars in China shouldn’t be counted. Yes, those are included. I don't agree that they should be excluded. — Troy Teslike (@TroyTeslike) September 24, 2022 I agree with Troy. They are electric cars and they should thus be counted as electric cars in these kinds of reports. Of course, one could certainly compare by vehicle class, but that’s not the task here. These cheap electric cars that have gotten quite popular in China have doors, roofs, cargo space, and are electric — they count. It’s fascinating to me that Tesla BEV market share has dropped from 25.1% in Q2 2020 to 15.6% in Q2 2022, but that doesn’t come across in the same way at all when you keep in mind that Tesla grew 180.2% in that timeframe. Also, recall that Elon Musk’s own long-term estimate or goal is that Tesla will settle at around 10% of the global auto market. We’ll see what comes of these trends in the coming year. Any forecasts?

       "   'content': \"Tesla’s AI Day 2022 is coming up quickly, and investors and fans alike are wondering what the event may hold. From the latest technology in its cars to upcoming projects — such as the Optimus robot, expected to be debuted this year — Tesla’s second AI Day event is likely to be full of pleasant surprises. When considering what to look out for at Tesla’s 2022 AI Day, the Optimus robot is expected to be shown off in full view, according to statements from Musk at the automaker’s annual stockholder’s meeting last month (via Forbes ). The project, announced at AI Day 2021, gained a massive press audience, and this year’s debut is likely to garner several onlookers. Last year, Tesla discussed the Optimus robot and unveiled its in-house D1 chip, which powered the company’s Dojo Supercomputer, along with other updates about its FSD beta, Autopilot, and other AI-related programs. While this year’s AI Day may be quite similar to last year’s, it also may include some important updates and, according to Tesla’s CEO, will feature a live-working Optimus robot. The Optimus robot from Tesla is a humanoid, AI-driven bot meant to help users perform basic, repetitive or dangerous tasks in daily life. CEO Elon Musk has previously suggested that the development could be a game-changer for the world, with some of Tesla’s first robots set to work in the company’s car factories. Additionally, Tesla is likely to provide updates on the Dojo Chip, which the company built on its own for the purpose of “pure machine learning.” It’s set to power Tesla’s next generation of AI technology, making it a huge development in general. Tesla will also talk about the future of robotaxis at the company, which has long been considered a link to future increases in valuation by bullish investors. The concept of Tesla’s robotaxis will require the use of Full Self-Driving, and is expected to let owners of the company’s cars to rent out their vehicles as self-driving taxis — though it’s unclear whether or not this is how it’ll turn out, since it’s at least a few years away. Among other things still, we’re also likely to hear more specific updates about Tesla’s FSD beta, which a select number of customers are testing already. With Musk previously stating a wider release of FSD as one of his two main goals for the end of this year, the FSD beta could also be slated to play a huge role in Tesla’s upcoming AI Day event. Tesla’s AI Day 2022 is scheduled for September 30 in Palo Alto, California. The event will be live-streamed, and those who were invited to attend must respond via email by September 28.

       "   'content': 'In an emailed tip sent to Teslarati, a reader shared that a filmmaker is hiring 75-100 social media influencers to record themselves bashing Elon Musk and Tesla. According to the tip, which included the screenshot below, the casting call is asking for influencers to bash Tesla, Elon Musk, and autonomous driving. The short film, titled Man Versus. Musk, is seeking “75-100 actors with a strong social media presence/following to read and self-record a new 10-15 minute monologue.” According to the casting call, which you can find here , the pay will be a flat rate of $100 for an estimated one hour of work. Influencers will need to record themselves reading the script and upload the video to social media before receiving the $100 payment. At the time of this writing, there are only two influencers who have read and uploaded the script which starts out as “Hey Everybody! How’s it going? Thanks for coming. I’m Jordan. Welcome to “Man Versus Musk” A show. A comedy. A call to action. A political movement that requires our attention and focus. More on the Musk matter later,” The script that the influencers record themselves reading claims that Elon Musk has been intentionally tone-deaf to distracted driving. “Fact, he has built his empire disempowering drivers from the ability to pay attention and keep their car on the road,” the script reads. According to the script, Tesla’s Ludicrous Mode is the greatest champion of distracted driving the world has ever seen. It says that Elon Musk has no interest in stopping what it calls destructive driving which would require drivers not to play on their phones while driving and change their behavior while behind the wheel. “He is the billionaire promoter of distracted driving. He’s built his wealth and reputation on the promise of the self-driving car. Over and over, Musk has declared that truly autonomous driving is nearly here! The day when a Tesla could drive itself — which it turns out is much further away than previous estimations. Extolling the virtues of auto-pilot, leading drivers to falsely believe that it is safe to keep their eyes off the road,” the script reads. It should be noted that Tesla has always emphasized that drivers pay attention and be prepared to take over when Autopilot and FSD Beta are engaged. As someone who has actually met Elon Musk, witnessed FSD Beta stop for cyclists and pedestrians, and has interviewed Tesla owners and read stories by owners whose lives have been saved by their cars , I find this film lacking in facts. I think the filmmaker does want to do good and see themself as doing good, but their actions are based upon misinformation and quite frankly, Tesla FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) that is often spread by the mainstream media. I think the focus should be on distracted driving and include facts and statistics such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) recent estimates of the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and compare those with Tesla’s own data. According to the NHTSA, in 2021 there were a total of 38,824 fatalities per 100 million VMT. Tesla published its own vehicle safety report for 2021 for each quarter and includes data showing whether or not a vehicle had Autopilot engaged. According to Tesla per quarter: Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021 For each quarter, Tesla said, “By comparison, NHTSA’s most recent data shows that in the United States there is an automobile crash every 484,000 miles.” Although Tesla documented accidents and the NHTSA documented fatalities, Tesla’s numbers show that with its Autopilot and active safety features engaged, there are fewer incidents than without. Personally, I find it sad and disheartening that this filmmaker isn’t using facts or data and is manipulating young people into spreading misinformation about Tesla, Elon Musk, and autonomous driving for an easy $100.
